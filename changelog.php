                    <h2>Recent updates</h2>
                    <h3>March 10th, 2016</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Updated the homepage. It should be more user friendly.</li>
                      <li>Added 'auto equip' functionality for inventory items of the heroes. This now also means stats should be adjusted by the more complex items. Also added an indication of a hero's attack dice.</li>
                      <li>Fixed an issue in Heirs of Blood where no next quest could be selected after Army of Dal'Zunm or Prison of Khinn.</li>
                      <li>Fixed an issue where the incorrect name was displayed for relics in Heirs of Blood</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>February 13th, 2016</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added Mists of Bilehall!</li>
                      <li>Added Treaty of Champions!</li>
                      <li>Added Zarihell, Ardus Ix'Erebus and Kyndrithul lieutenant packs!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>February 11th, 2016</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Implemented a new way to select the next quest: Quest balance, duration and flavour text is now shown. There is also an indication of why a certain quest is available/unavailable.</li>
                      <li>Fixed the rewards for mini campaigns. The overlord will now receive bonus XP, the heroes will receive a free item and there is a check in place to see if a relic has already been obtained by the heroes or the Overlord. I recommend that if you started a Mini Campaign (LotW, Trollfens or MoR) in the past, to restart the campaign to make sure it is correct.</li>
